<b> The Project will require following hardware:-</b>
    <li>Arduino UNO.</li>
    <li>Raspberry Pi(Any model, (Raspberry Pi 3B 1GB ram in my case.)</li>
    <li>Jumper wires.</li>
    <li>TMP 36 sensor.</li>
    <li>HDMI cable full size.</li>
    <li>TV or Monitor.</li>
    <li>Charger 5V, 2A type B.</li>
    <li>SD card 16 GB (Minimum).</li>
<hr>
<li>The arduino.ino code is fes into the arduino</li>
<li>Then rapsberry pi connections with the TV is done.</li>
<li>The appropriate files are fed into the rapsberry pi.</li>
<li>Then arduino is connected to the Raspberry Pi</li>
<li>Raspberry Pi is switched ON.</li>
<li>In above process the target file is noted.</li>
<li>Then same file is then triggered</li>
<li>Data from arduino is taken by Raspberry Pi.</li>
<li>Same data is proceesed and displayed on webpage</li>
